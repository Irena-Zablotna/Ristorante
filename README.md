# Ristorante
Itâ€™s a project that represents the website of a restaurant with the following features:
-presents menu, dishes via image slider, location (built-in map), contact details
-also allows you to make and manage online bookings (create, modify and cancel)
-allows you to register on the site and sends email confirmation.
There is also the additional feature for the Admin role, which has the possibility to access the dedicated page whereit manages the menu through CRUD operations.
The application was created in .Net Core 3.1. 
Languages and technologies used are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Jquery, C#, Microsoft Identity, Entity Framework, Entity Framework Power Tools.
As Database I used SQL Server by choosing the Database First approach.

The latest version is the Identity-bootstrap branch.
